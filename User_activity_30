The activity_type column is an ENUM (category) of type ('open_session', 'end_session', 'scroll_down', 'send_message').
The table shows the user activities for a social media website. 
Note that each session belongs to exactly one user.

 

Write a solution to find the daily active user count for a period of 30 days ending 2019-07-27 inclusively. A user was active on someday if they made at least one activity on that day.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

Note: Any activity from ('open_session', 'end_session', 'scroll_down', 'send_message') will be considered valid activity for a user to be considered active on a day.



# Write your MySQL query statement below
with active_user as (
    select  activity_date as day , count(distinct user_id) as active_users
    from Activity 
    where activity_type is not null
    group by activity_date
)
select * from active_user
where day  between '2019-06-28' and '2019-07-28'
